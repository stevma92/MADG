<h1>Procedure</h1>

  <font size="3" face="arial">
   Police can stop your vehicle on suspicion of illegal activity and criminal behaviour or for random drug / alcohol tests. Since the introduction of the random breath test, a police officer can pull you over anytime they’d like to administer the breath alcohol exam, regardless whether you have committed a crime or not.
   <br><br>
   During a stop, police may ask you for your name and address, as well as a valid WA drivers license. The police will take your license to their vehicle for a background check on your name and the vehicle to ensure there’s no outstanding court or enforcement orders against you. If there isn’t, then the officer will simply hand your license back to you.
