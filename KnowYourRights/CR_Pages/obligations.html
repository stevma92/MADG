    WA Police require the input and cooperation from the community when dealing with crimes and suspicious activity in the area. Upon assisting police, the community may help to ensure the safety of local areas. Although these obligations aren't legal requirements, they are morally right. These obligations include:
    
      <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
        <li>Compliance and respect for the law</li>
        <li>Assisting police by reporting any information concerning an offence or suspicious activity</li>
        <li>Respecting police officers during interactions </li>
        <li>Complying with police when given direction</li>
       
      </ul>
