    In WA, police may pull you over randomly or if they suspect you have committed an offence, and you will then be subject to an RBT. The RBT process is as follows:
    <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
        <li>Police will administer you with a breathalyser machine for you to blow into(BAC)</li>
        <li>The device will produce a Blood Alcohol Concentration (BAC) reading</li>
        <li>If you fall within legal limits, police will let you go</li>
        <li>If you fail the RBT, you are under arrest for drink driving and will be taken to a police station for secondary breath analysis</li>
       
      </ul>
