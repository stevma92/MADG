    Always know your limits if you are planning to drive after drinking alcohol. Sometimes, calling a taxi or uber is best if you are unsure of your blood alcohol level. 
    <br><br>
    Researchers found that driving with a blood alcohol level of around 0.05 would double the chances of having an accident. With alcohol consumption comes sets of laws, which state:

      <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
        <li>Legal limit for drivers with a full WA driversâ€™ license is 0.05% Blood Alcohol Concentration (BAC)</li>
        <li>For novice drivers, disqualified drivers, drivers on an Extraordinary License or drivers with heavy loads, the legal limit is strictly 0.00% BAC.</li>
       
      </ul>
