Stop and search is a procedure used by
police  forces to reduce  crime rates,
prevent  potential  for crime  and to
protect the community.

The police may  seek  to  search anyone
who is suspected of or known to possess
illegal items, for example, weapons and
illicit drugs.

These are often performed in  crime hot
spot areas where suspicious activity is
present.
